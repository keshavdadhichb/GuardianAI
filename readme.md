# GuardianAI

## Overview
GuardianAI delivers **AI-powered proactive personal safety**—your silent guardian and immutable proof. The system monitors both auditory and visual cues for signs of distress, leveraging AI models to detect threats in real time from audio files and visual streams. Blockchain technology ensures all evidence is securely stored and tamper-proof, providing legal admissibility and trust.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Threat Detection:** Detects distress signals such as screams, cries for help, and threatening gestures using advanced AI models.
- **Audio File Processing:** Converts incoming audio into vector arrays using pretrained speech models. Evaluates confidence scores and classifies the environment as **safe** or **unsafe**.
- **Blockchain-Certified Evidence:** Stores audio-visual evidence on the Polygon blockchain for immutability and legal admissibility.
- **App:** The app records the environment audio when activated and this audio file is sent to the model to detect safe/unsafe environment. 
- **Legally Admissible Proof:** Ensures all captured data is tamper-proof for court and legal proceedings.
- **Visual + Audio AI:** Uses technologies like TensorFlow and OpenCV for multi-modal detection.

## Project Workflow
1. Monitor environment for streams of audio and video.
2. Use AI models to analyze data for distress cues.
3. Convert audio samples to vector arrays and compute confidence threshold for classification.
4. Classify scene as ‘safe’ or ‘unsafe’; trigger alert if unsafe.
5. Store relevant evidence in blockchain for secure retrieval.
